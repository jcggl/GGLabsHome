            A tiny piece of grain that fell off from the space rocket orbiting the moon collided with gas started
            exploring around the stars and one wholesome planet was born. The ancestors who started their journey named
            the planet, “The Alcohol Planet.” They scattered all around the planet and started expanding to their own
            unique species.<br /><br />Beergang is a tribe that has the longest history of inheriting the purest form of
            a brewery who formed their livelihoods in the Herong River, the longest river that flows across The Alcohol
            Planet. They are largely composed of four tribes, Liquid, Start, Redpoll, Cloudx. If you include the
            minority tribes, there are countless tries that form Beergang.<br /><br />There have been endless battles
            against each other to unite all the tribes and create a great empire here at The Alcohol Planet. Knowing
            that there would be bloody battles and alliances, Beergang trained themselves relentlessly. The river
            brought prosperity to Beergang. With their rich economy, they were much more technologically advanced than
            other tribes on the planet.<br /><br />However, the wealth gave more reasons for people to be wastefully
            drinking. It caused them to become lazy. In order to control the issue, the central government passed a bill
            that allowed people to drink only in ‘GangHouse.’  Thus, Beergangs started gathering in the GangHouse, one
            by one, to enjoy drinking and strengthen the friendship between the tribes. What is going on here in this
            magical place called GangHouse?
